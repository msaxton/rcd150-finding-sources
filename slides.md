##  5 Tips for Finding Sources for your Research
#### RCD 150: RCD Theories and Methods



### 1. Find the right databases for you.

* Are you looking for primary or secondary sources?
* Are you looking for books or articles?
* Are you looking for a specific disciplinary lens?

Compare the following databases:
* [European Colonialism in the Early 20th Century: French Colonialism in Africa: From Algeria to Madagascar, 1910-1930](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=ECFenchGDSC) 
* [Race Relations Abstracts](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=RsrcRcrdRaceRlatns)
* [Social Science Database](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=PQSocSciJrnl)
* [JSTOR](http://www.library.tufts.edu/ezproxy/ezproxy.asp?LOCATION=JSTOR)

#### Know what your database is searching
What is the difference between "JumboSearch", "Tufts Catalog", and "Libraries Worldwide"?


### 2. Combine keywords and subject terms in your searches.

What is a keyword?  

What is a subject term?

#### How to find subject terms
1. Examine the subject terms associated with items returned from keyword searching.
2. Browse the subject terms used in the database.


### 3. Consult Reference sources.

Reference sources (bibliographies, encyclopedias, and handbooks) provide helpful summaries, background information, and bibliographies on your topic.

### 4. Use Google, but use it wisely.

Using Google wisely
* Google does not contain (index) all available sources.
* Google will customize your search results based your previous sources.
* Google does not rank its results based on credibility.
* [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is more useful for finding scholarly literature than the main Google search.


### 5. Ask a librarian
